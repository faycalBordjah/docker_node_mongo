# Start Wars API Bind

Star wars api bind planet is an API done with Symfony framework. It allows you to connect to [SWAP API](https://swapi.co/) to illustrate how to use tests.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
* A computer with Linux or MacOs 
> For Windows OS it is more complicated to install the application
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - install on ubuntu dist:
    ```bash

    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```
    ```bash
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    ```

* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction)
